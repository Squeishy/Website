                (I wasn’t sure whether to use About Me or About Us since my company is just me, but... oh well, I’ll go with About Me.)

            <h1>About me</h1>
            <p>
                So, hi! I’m Jordan, a French little dude that just entered the adult life, I love pretty much everything related to computers and technology in general.
            </p>
            <p>
                Alright! So you want to know more about me, huh? Well, here’s my whole timeline (so far):
                When I was a little kid, I loved going on the computers at my school. I was terrible with them back then, but I absolutely loved programming on a little website called Scratch (you can check it out here: <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/" target="_blank" title = "link to scratch">Scratch</a>). I kept playing around with Scratch for a while, but at some point, I wanted to become a doctor. Despite that, I was already dabbling in Unity.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, I quickly realized that biology was way too difficult for my not-so-scientific brain. So, I decided to pursue a programming course where I learned Python and a bit of HTML. At the same time, I started using Unity more seriously, and I fell in love with it.
            </p>
            <p>
                These days, I’m studying web development, focusing on everything related to the internet, such as design, websites, communication, and so on. I’ll be doing this for the next three years, but my ultimate goal is to join a video game school, which I plan to attend for around two years.
            </p>
            <h1>My Plan</h1>
            <p>
                First, I want to be done with school and gain experience and work a bit on my company. After that, I’d like to join a big company like Microsoft or Ubisoft to learn even more. Once I’ve gained enough knowledge and experience, I’ll try to create my own game studio or just continue my company, that got the time to grow in the mean time, though I’m not sure yet how it will turn out.
            </p> 
            <h1>My advice for aspiring Game Developers</h1>
            <p>
                If you want to create games like me, here’s my advice:
            </p>
            <p>
                - Work on projects outside of school. Show that you’re passionate about what you do! Trust me, it’ll make it so much easier to get into a good school.
            </p>
            <p>
                - Don’t just focus on video games. Work on other areas that can help you grow. For example, I create YouTube videos from time to time, which helps me develop important skills like recording, scripting, video editing, writing, finding ideas, audio management, and more.
            </p>
            <p>
                - Do what you love. I wanted to be a doctor at some point, but now that I look back, I realize it wasn’t for me (plus, I hate blood, so why did I even consider that?).
