                <p id="text-dashing-krew-description">
                    "Dashing Krew" is a game where a little alien must find his way back to the mothership using the abilities of UFOs from his friends.

                    Unless Apple lowers their prices, I’ll always be an Android kind of person. So yes, it’ll be released on Android!

                <h5 id="text-dashing-progress">Progress</h5>
                <p id="text-dashing-progress-details">
                    I’d say the game is about 15% complete. I still need to work on cutscenes, music, levels, mechanics, and so much more, the list never ends!

                <h5 id="text-dashing-trivia">Trivia</h5>
                <p id="text-dashing-dk-inspiration">
                    You might wonder why I spelled "Crew" with a "K." The reason is that this game is inspired by the barrel sections of Donkey Kong Country Returns, where Donkey Kong hops between barrels to progress. Like in this game! Also, both Donkey Kong and Dashing Krew share the initials "DK."
                </p>
                <img id="alt-kenny-image" src="images/kenny-keny.png" alt="Image of Kenny from South Park and an alien from Dashing Krew">
                <p id="text-dashing-kenny">
                    You might also notice that the aliens look familiar. If you think they resemble Kenny from South Park, you’re absolutely right! That’s where I got the inspiration. (I officially call him Keny, with only one "n.")
                </p>
                <p id="text-dashing-previous-game">
                    This isn’t the first game where they’ve appeared. They were initially 3D characters in a game called HAW (Home Appliance War), but I eventually abandoned that project. Later, either for a school project or just for my own entertainment, I created EPIC SNOW FIGHTER 4K 60FPS DELUXE (I’m bad at naming things), which you can see below.
