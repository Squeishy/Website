                    This company I will establish will manage all my games. Perhaps, in the distant future, I could start hiring people, maybe even you!

                <h5>Why create a company?</h5>
                <p>
                    Well, to avoid tax issues, you need to inform the government about your earnings. That’s the main reason I’m creating this company. Additionally, it will help secure copyrights for my games, and who knows? Maybe, one day, it will grow to be as big as Nintendo (let’s be honest, it probably won’t, but it’s fun to dream)!

                <h5>Is it hard to start?</h5>
                <p>
                    Not really, but also yes. The process itself isn’t difficult, but it takes a lot of time and patience, you have no idea!
                </p>
                <h5>Trivia</h5>
                <p>
                    Why "Ducky Factory"? Well, I have 132 rubber ducks in my room and love them. Plus, my biggest game is centered around a duck!

                <h5>Release Date: Around 2025/2026</h5>
                <p>
                    "Dashing Krew" is a game where a little alien must find his way back to the mothership using the abilities of UFOs from his friends.

                <h5>Which platform?</h5>
                <p>
                    Unless Apple lowers their prices, I’ll always be an Android kind of person. So yes, it’ll be released on Android!
                </p>
                <h5>Progress</h5>
                <p>
                    I’d say the game is about 15% complete. I still need to work on cutscenes, music, levels, mechanics, and so much more, the list never ends!
                </p>
                <h5>Trivia</h5>
                <p>
                    You might wonder why I spelled "Crew" with a "K." The reason is that this game is inspired by the barrel sections of Donkey Kong Country Returns, where Donkey Kong hops between barrels to progress. Like in this game! Also, both Donkey Kong and Dashing Krew share the initials "DK."
                </p>
                <img src="images/kenny-keny.png" alt="Image of Kenny from South Park and an alien from Dashing Krew">
                <p>
                    You might also notice that the aliens look familiar. If you think they resemble Kenny from South Park, you’re absolutely right! That’s where I got the inspiration. (I officially call him Keny, with only one "n.")
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, this isn’t the first game where they’ve appeared. They were initially 3D characters in a game called HAW (Home Appliance War), but I eventually abandoned that project.
