                    "Dashing Krew" is a game where a little alien has to find his way back to the mother ship using the abilities of the ufos of his friends, use them at your advantage to make your way through many dangers and, perhaps, go back home !

                <h5>For what platform?</h5>
                <p>
                    Unless Apple changes their price, I'll always be an android type of guy, so yeah it'll be out for android!
                </p>
                <h5>Progress</h5>
                <p>
                    I'd say the game is about 15% done, I still need cutscene, musics, time, more level, more mecahnics, and so on, the list never ends!
                </p>
                <h5>Trivia</h5>
                <p>
                    You may wonder why I spelled Crew with a "K", the reason behind this is actually because this games take inspiration from the barrels section from Donkey Kong Country Returns, where Donkey Kong needs to hop between barrels to reach the end, like in this game, and you may notice that both the initials of Donkey Kong and Dashing Krew are, welp, "DK".

                <p>
                    You may also noticed that the aliens may look familiar, if you're thinking they look like Kenny from South Park, welp you'd be correct, because that's where I took the inspiration from! (I officialy call him Keny, with only one "n")

                    Also, this is not the first game they appear, they wern't 2d at the beginning, but 3D, and they were fighting in a game called HAW, or home appliance war, but I abandonned this project since then!
