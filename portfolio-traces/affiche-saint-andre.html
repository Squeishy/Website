    <h2 id="presentation-title">Presentation</h2>

    <p id="presentation-text">
        The city of Saint-André-les-Vergers had organized a competition where we had to <strong>create a poster to promote the event "<em>Saint-André in game</em>"</strong>. Without hesitation, I launched <em>Adobe Illustrator</em> and got to work!
    </p>

    <h2 id="process-title">Creation Process</h2>
    
    <p id="process-intro">
        In the space of an <strong>afternoon (5-6 hours)</strong>, I created my poster. Here's the result:
    </p>

    <img src="images/portfolio/affiche-1.webp" alt="image of the poster" id="affiche-1">
    
    <p id="process-result">
        Well, spoiler alert: <strong>my poster didn't win</strong>. But that's okay! I was able to practice while having fun. So, I'll reveal the behind-the-scenes of the creation!
    </p>
    <p id="process-approach">
        For this poster, I didn't <strong>try to be original at all costs</strong>. My goal was to <strong>practice by reproducing designs that I liked</strong>. Like a fusion of inspirations found online!
    </p>
    <p id="process-inspiration">
        For example, in the game "<em>Thank Goodness You're Here</em>", at one point in the game, the hero accidentally flies into the air holding a balloon. I love this scene, which presents a <strong>calm and peaceful situation</strong>, and I wanted to transcribe it onto my poster... And that's what I did!<strong><br></strong>
    </p>

    <img src="images/portfolio/affiche-2.webp" alt="Screenshot of the game Thank Goodness You're Here" id="affiche-2">
    <img src="images/portfolio/affiche-3.webp" alt="Screenshot of the same scene, recreated in Illustrator" id="affiche-3">

    <p id="process-drawing">
        Obviously, I didn't just take a screenshot. I <strong>redrew everything</strong>, while keeping <strong>the base colors and given style</strong>!
    </p>
    <p id="process-details">
        Then, I added <strong>details to fill my poster</strong>, starting with simple balloons:
    </p> 
    
    <img src="images/portfolio/affiche-4.webp" alt="Image of balloons" id="affiche-4">
    
    <p id="process-technique">
        I <strong>used the shape builder tool</strong> to create shadows (for reference, this tool allows merging or cutting objects in contact,) nothing too complicated! Then I had the idea to add <strong>an airplane with a banner displaying information</strong>, like the date or entry price.<strong><br></strong>
    </p> 

    <img src="images/portfolio/affiche-5.webp" alt="Image of an airplane with a banner displaying information" id="affiche-5">
    <img src="images/portfolio/affiche-6.webp" alt="Image of the airplane" id="affiche-6">

    <p id="process-elements">
        I then <strong>created other small elements</strong>, like chess pieces or cards, using the pen tool to trace them from models. Easy and effective!
    </p>

    <img src="images/portfolio/affiche-7.webp" alt="Image of chess pieces and cards in adobe illustrator" id="affiche-7">

    <p id="process-final">
        At this stage, I just had to add the information, export the image... and it was done!
    </p>

    <h2 id="trivia-title">Trivia</h2>
    
    <p id="trivia-content">
        If you take a look at my layer list, you'll see that I took particular care <strong>to properly organize and rename objects</strong>. (I love organizing my projects, it makes everything so much nicer and cleaner!)
    </p>

    <h2 id="conclusion-title">Conclusion</h2>
    
    <p id="conclusion-text">
        In summary: this project was super fun to create! Even though I didn't win, I'll surely try my luck again in a future competition. And this time, I'll try to be a bit more original in my designs, now that I better master <em>Adobe Illustrator</em>!
