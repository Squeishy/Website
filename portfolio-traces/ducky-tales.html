    <h3 id="presentation-title">Presentation</h3>
  
    <p id="presentation-intro"><em>Ducky Tales</em> is my <strong>first truly commercialized game</strong>, it must be the 15th or 20th project I've created, and by far <strong>the one that went the furthest, as it's even available on the Play Store today!</strong></p>
  
    <img src="images/portfolio/ducky-tales-1.webp" alt="Screenshot of Ducky Tales gameplay" id="ducky-tales-1">
  
    <p id="presentation-description">In <em>Ducky Tales</em>, you play as a <strong>cute little plastic duck</strong> who has only one goal in life: <strong>reach its bathtub</strong>, which marks the end of the level. You'll have to avoid the abysses of your bathroom (the floor) <strong>by doing</strong> <strong>parkour on bathroom elements</strong>, like bottles, bubbles, washing machines, and more.</p>
  
    <img src="images/portfolio/ducky-tales-2.webp" alt="Screenshot of Ducky Tales gameplay" id="ducky-tales-2">
  
    <p id="presentation-audience">The game is <strong>designed for children</strong>, but it can <strong>very well be played by everyone</strong> (including you!)</p>
  
    <h3 id="gameplay-title">The Game</h3>
  
    <p id="gameplay-mechanics"><em>Ducky Tales</em> is a platform game. Your <strong>duck moves left and right based on where you touch the screen</strong>, but it <strong>automatically makes small jumps</strong>. So it's up to you to <strong>land properly so your duck doesn't fall</strong>!</p>
    <p id="gameplay-levels">The game features <strong>30 unique levels</strong> and <strong>55 levels in total</strong>, divided into three main parts:</p>
    <p id="normal-levels">The <strong>normal levels</strong>, where the goal is <strong>simply to reach the bathtub at the end of the level</strong>. There's nothing special, but each of these levels has three star pieces to collect.</p>
  
    <img src="images/portfolio/ducky-tales-3.webp" alt="Screenshot of normal level gameplay" id="ducky-tales-3">
  
    <p id="challenge-levels-intro">The <strong>challenge levels</strong>, where the objective is still to reach the bathtub, but with <strong>additional challenges</strong>. For example:</p>
  
    <ul id="challenge-list">
      <li id="challenge-1">Avoid <strong>mean ducks</strong> that follow every player movement.</li>
      <li id="challenge-2">Collect <strong>red coins</strong> to finish the level.</li>
      <li id="challenge-3">Complete the level <strong>before the timer runs out</strong>.</li>
      <li id="challenge-4">Play with a <strong>much bigger or much smaller duck</strong>, which changes gravity.</li>
    </ul>
  
    <img src="images/portfolio/ducky-tales-4.webp" alt="Screenshot of challenge level gameplay" id="ducky-tales-4">
    <img src="images/portfolio/ducky-tales-5.webp" alt="Screenshot of challenge level gameplay" id="ducky-tales-5">
  
    <p id="expert-levels">The <strong>expert levels</strong>, five in number, are <strong>even more difficult</strong>! To unlock them, you need to complete a certain number of special levels, 5 special levels completed for the first expert level, 10 for the second, 15 for the third... You get the idea. <strong>These levels offer crowns to players</strong>, ranging from bronze to royal.</p>
  
    <img src="images/portfolio/ducky-tales-6.webp" alt="Screenshot of expert level gameplay" id="ducky-tales-6">

    <p id="variants-intro">All levels are based on the same basic mechanic (the jumping duck), but some introduce variants:</p>

    <ul id="variants-list">
      <li id="variant-1">Levels where the duck must <strong>take a boat and shoot at elements so they don't destroy your boat</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
  
    <img src="images/portfolio/ducky-tales-7.webp" alt="Screenshot of boat gameplay" id="ducky-tales-7">

    <ul id="variants-list-2">
      <li id="variant-2">Levels where the duck <strong>transforms into a ball by going through a washing machine</strong>, allowing it to literally <strong>roll through the level</strong>. The music also speeds up based on its speed.</li>
    </ul>
  
    <img src="images/portfolio/ducky-tales-8.webp" alt="Screenshot of ball transformation gameplay" id="ducky-tales-8">
  
    <p id="secret-options">Once the player has completed all levels, they'll unlock <strong>secret options</strong>. A chest will appear in the menu, containing <strong>green glasses</strong>. A safe will also be visible, but you'll need to find its code!<strong><br></strong></p>
  
    <img src="images/portfolio/ducky-tales-9.webp" alt="Screenshot of secret options menu" id="ducky-tales-9">
  
    <p id="green-glasses"><strong>By equipping the green glasses, the game reveals hidden green keys, allowing you to purchase special upgrades.</strong></p>

    <h3 id="art-direction-title">Art Direction</h3>

    <p id="art-intro">Let's be honest for five seconds, <strong>art is not my greatest quality</strong>. So I needed a <strong>simple graphic style</strong>, <strong>easy to create</strong>, <strong>but still beautiful</strong>. Vector art helped me enormously!</p>
    <p id="art-method">I created all the game's assets with Figma. Here's my artistic method:</p>

    <img src="images/portfolio/ducky-tales-13.webp" alt="Screenshot of Figma workspace" id="ducky-tales-13">

    <ol id="art-steps">
      <li id="art-step-1"><strong>A shape</strong></li>
      <li id="art-step-2"><strong>A bright color</strong></li>
      <li id="art-step-3"><strong>A drop shadow, bottom right.</strong></li>
    </ol>

    <img src="images/portfolio/ducky-tales-14.webp" alt="Screenshot of art style example" id="ducky-tales-14">

    <p id="art-style"><strong>Everything must be as round as possible: It's a children's game after all!</strong></p>
  
    <h2 id="ambiance-title">A Refined Ambiance</h2>

    <p id="ambiance-intro">I really like <strong>jazz</strong>, and I thought it fit well with the game's overall atmosphere. Alas, I had never really composed music before, and I didn't know the jazz techniques exactly.</p>
    <p id="ambiance-experiment">By experimenting, I managed to <strong>create several "jazz" pieces</strong> (I put quotes because even though I used typical jazz instruments, I don't really master jazz composition).</p>
    <p id="ambiance-advice">If you install the game, I recommend listening carefully to the music to get an idea!</p>

    <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KwJBeIGiDFYEzDzVhDhDuaTQQPc_esXz" id="music-link">(You can find the music here)</a>

    <h2 id="ads-title">Ads and Release</h2>

    <p id="ads-intro">This game, although free, <strong>has advertisements</strong>, and believe me when I tell you that setting this up was more than a nightmare, I think I spent more time making the ad system and putting it online than making the game itself.</p>
    <p id="ads-unity">So, we start, <strong><em>Unity</em> has a super ad system, too cool! Everything works on the first try, nothing to complain about!</strong></p>
    <p id="ads-age">The game is ready to be released, but at the time, <strong>I was only 17, so Google Play didn't want to put my game online</strong> (and they had completely blocked my account). So I decided to wait a long year before putting it online, on another account.</p>
    <p id="ads-ironsource">Except that in the meantime, <strong><em>Unity</em>, <span style="font-size: 14pt;">smart guys</span> that they are, decided to change their perfect ad system and switch to the <em>IronSource</em> platform</strong>, another ad provider, so I had to <strong>delete all the ad system from my game and start from scratch</strong>, so I recoded everything, with a tutorial that lasted 45 minutes, a real treat.</p>
    
    <img src="images/portfolio/ducky-tales-15.webp" alt="Screenshot of ad system implementation" id="ducky-tales-15">

    <p id="ads-bugs">I try my game, <strong>nothing works</strong>, so we have to spend <strong>2 weeks finding the bugs</strong>, which I finally found!</p>
    <p id="ads-release">1 year later, <strong>I'm finally an adult</strong>, I can <strong>put my game online, it's online,</strong> and now we need to <strong>notify <em>IronSource</em> that the game is online and they can put ads on it</strong>! Which happens, surprisingly, without too many problems.</p>
    <p id="ads-google">Except that then, <em>Google Play</em> contacts me:&nbsp;</p>
    <p id="ads-google-message"><em> Hi Jordan! Great game for kids, the problem is that your ads are playable, and that's not good for children.&nbsp;</em></p>
    
    <img src="images/portfolio/ducky-tales-16.webp" alt="Screenshot of Google Play message" id="ducky-tales-16">

    <p id="ads-ironsource-fix">I didn't really see why this was a problem, but in any case, I try to fix this issue on the <em>IronSource</em> website, and I see the option "<strong>Iron Source will not provide playable ads</strong>", I check this option and try my game, the ads are still playable, I think then that we need to wait, and so I wait, 1 day, then 2, 3, and yet, <strong>I still have playable ads!</strong> So I go contact the Iron Source team.</p>
    <p id="ads-email-intro">And that was the <strong>most useless and counterproductive month</strong> of my life, I'll give you a quick summary of all the emails I sent:&nbsp;</p>
    
    <p id="ads-email-1"><em> Hello IronSource, my ads are playable even though I don't want them to be playable</em></p>
    <p id="ads-email-2"><em> Hello Jordan! What's your email?</em></p>
    <p id="ads-email-3"><em> Hello IronSource, it's mymail@mail.com</em></p>
    <p id="ads-email-4"><em> Hello Jordan! What's your game id?</em></p>
    <p id="ads-email-5"><em> Hello IronSource, it's 0656523164</em></p>
    <p id="ads-email-6"><em> Hello Jordan! It's all good we fixed everything!</em></p>
    <p id="ads-email-7"><em> Hello IronSource, I still have playable ads.</em></p>
    <p id="ads-email-8"><em> Hello Jordan! Can you be more specific?</em></p>
    <p id="ads-email-9"><em> Hello IronSource, I still have playable ads after 5 seconds of waiting, can you remove them?</em></p>
    <p id="ads-email-10"><em> Hello Jordan! the email mymail@mail.com doesn't work, are you sure you sent us the right one?</em></p>
    <p id="ads-email-11"><em> Hello dear IronSource, yes, I'm sure, <strong>I've sent you 10 emails with this same account and there have never been any problems before</strong>.</em></p>
    <p id="ads-email-12"><em> Hello Jordan, we didn't find any playable ads in your game, can you send us the ads you got?</em></p>
    <p id="ads-email-13"><em> Hello IronSource, yes, I only got playable ads, like Paper.io2, RollingBalls, etc...</em></p>
    <p id="ads-email-14"><em> Hello Jordan, can you tell us when you got these ads?</em></p>
    <p id="ads-email-15"><em> Hello IronSource, yes I got these ads at 16:45, 16:46, 16:47.</em></p>
    <p id="ads-email-16"><em> Hello Jordan, can you tell us your timezone?</em></p>
    <p id="ads-email-17"><em> Hello IronSource, yes, it's UTC+1.</em></p>
    <p id="ads-email-18"><em> Hello Jordan, it's good, actually the button to close the ad was directing to a game demo, it's good!</em></p>
    
    <img src="images/portfolio/ducky-tales-17.webp" alt="Screenshot of IronSource dashboard" id="ducky-tales-17">
    
    <p id="ads-conclusion">After that, <strong>everything was good</strong>. Maybe I should have given them more information from the start, but they could also have asked precisely what they needed. In short, this back-and-forth lasted a month, but it allowed me to <strong>better understand email exchanges in a professional context</strong>.</p>
    <p id="ads-company">Besides, now that <strong>my game earns me money, I have to declare it to the State</strong>. As you can guess, I had to create <em>L'Usine Canard</em>, my company, to <strong>commercialize my game legally.</strong></p>
    <p id="ads-timeline">I spent three months developing it... and a year doing all the paperwork.</p>
    <p id="ads-earnings">All that, to earn fifty cents in total! But at least, I learned a lot: <strong>company management, sending professional emails, better organization and even game debugging</strong>.</p>
    
    <img src="images/portfolio/ducky-tales-18.webp" alt="Screenshot of game earnings" id="ducky-tales-18">
  
    <h2 id="promotion-title">Game Promotion</h2>
    
    <p id="promotion-intro"><strong>Promoting the game</strong> <strong>is a real challenge</strong>. Offering in-game ads is already complicated, but what's even more difficult is promoting it. Once again, <strong>I found myself facing something I had never done, and I had (and still have) to learn how to manage this part</strong>.</p>
    
    <img src="images/portfolio/ducky-tales-19.webp" alt="Screenshot of promotion strategy" id="ducky-tales-19">
    
    <p id="promotion-target">For an advertisement to work, you first need to <strong>define your target.</strong> In my case, it's <strong>children</strong>... or rather, those who give them access to the game. <strong>Many children don't have phones</strong>, so it's <strong>their parents who lend them theirs</strong>. Ultimately, <strong>the real target isn't children, but parents.</strong></p>
    <p id="promotion-strategy">I had planned to make <strong>serious advertisements on Facebook to reach parents</strong>, and <strong>more offbeat ads on Instagram</strong>. But after talking with a professor during a meeting organized by the <em>YEC (Young Entrepreneur Center)</em> about AI and social networks, I learned that <strong>most adults are now on Instagram and Facebook is already outdated</strong>.</p> 
    <p id="promotion-advice">Later, while exchanging with a certain Maxime, the founder of <em>Naaranetwork</em>, I understood something essential: <strong>no matter the platform, you shouldn't just post in a loop</strong>. Otherwise, you quickly <strong>get perceived as a spammer or a bot by the algorithm</strong>. The right approach is to <strong>use the app regularly and naturally for a week or two before posting your ads</strong>. I haven't implemented this strategy yet, but it means I'll have to use <em>TikTok</em>... My <strong>worst</strong> nightmare.</p>

    <h3 id="opinion-title">My Opinion on the Game?</h3>
    
    <p id="opinion-content"><em>Ducky Tales</em> is clearly not my best creation. It was mainly <strong>a crash test to familiarize myself with the world of video games</strong>. But it helped me enormously, as it taught me to integrate modules, think about user experience, manage the release and all the paperwork that goes with it. And damn, it's still my first video game completed from A to Z!</p>
