    <h2 id="presentation-title">Presentation</h2>

    <p id="presentation-text">As part of our SAE 104, our objective was to <strong>create an interview video</strong>. The principle was simple: <strong>one of us had to introduce themselves and be interviewed on any topic.</strong> Some chose to talk about music, others about art or video games, while my group and I decided to focus on a more professional theme related to business.</p>
    
    <h2 id="preparation-title">The Preparation</h2>

    <p id="preparation-location">Before even thinking about filming, it was essential to <strong>determine where and how we would film</strong>. Finding an appropriate location was the first step: after some research, <strong>I managed to secure two rooms at the Troyes technopole</strong>. These places offered an ideal professional setting, reinforcing the credibility of our interview, since it's a business incubator (it's where I have my company.)</p>

    <p id="preparation-script">Then, we <strong>wrote a script</strong>, not only to structure the interview but also to <strong>anticipate responses and ensure fluid and coherent speech</strong>. Out of eight questions and answers, we finally kept three or four.</p>

    <p id="preparation-decor">We couldn't just settle for a neutral background like a wall. It was necessary to <strong>create a set that matched the atmosphere</strong> <strong>we wanted to convey.</strong> Since our theme was about entrepreneurship in video games, we needed to combine professionalism with aesthetics related to this universe. So we brought various objects from home, like books and office accessories, to make the environment more natural. We even added string lights to make it more dynamic!</p>

    <p id="preparation-location-visit">Before shooting, <strong>we went to the technopole to inspect the premises</strong>. That's when we chose the two rooms and determined where to shoot our scenes. We also <strong>created a technical breakdown and storyboard to optimize our efficiency.</strong> You can find these elements at the top of this topic!</p>
    
    <h2 id="shooting-title">The Shooting: A Race Against Time</h2>
    
    <p id="shooting-roles">Once on site, we quickly set up the equipment. <strong>My role was to answer questions, while my colleague conducted the interview</strong>. Three other team members were respectively in charge of sound, camera, and lighting. We had to work fast because our two camera batteries weren't powerful enough to last all day! Moreover, our access to the equipment was limited to the afternoon, as we had to share it with other teams.</p>
    <p id="shooting-method">To save time and get a cleaner result, we chose to record in two parts: <strong>first all the answers, then all the questions. This method saved us from repositioning the camera for each take, but added an extra challenge to the editing</strong>, as everything had to be cut and reorganized in the right order.</p>
    <p id="shooting-broll">Apart from that, we also shot some B-roll footage, for example when entering the technopole, walking down a hallway, scrolling through a PC screen, or playing one of my games to illustrate the scene!</p>

    <p id="subtitles">We also had to <strong>subtitle the video in English</strong>, but that was just a detail. It just required translating and adding text. The girls translated, and I believe I was the one who added them all to the video!</p>
    
    <h2 id="editing-title">The Editing</h2>
    
    <p id="editing-process">Editing was a crucial step in structuring the video and ensuring its fluidity. It wasn't just about assembling takes, but also about <strong>giving rhythm and coherence to the whole</strong>. At times, we used an effect where the voice appears before the image, creating a more natural continuity. This effect also reinforced the "documentary" aspect of the video, increasing viewer immersion. Speaking of coherence, <strong>we also had to ensure that our voice sound remained consistent throughout, and I took care of that during editing!</strong></p>
    
    <img src="images/portfolio/interview-10.webp" alt="Screenshot of the editing timeline" id="interview-10">
    
    <p id="editing-graphics">To help viewers identify the speakers, I added digital "post-its" indicating everyone's names and roles.</p>
    
    <img src="images/portfolio/interview-11.webp" alt="Example of name tags in the video" id="interview-11">
    
    <p id="editing-effects">Additionally, to make it more dynamic, <strong>I integrated our logo and applied blur to certain parts to highlight key elements, like headlines.</strong></p>
    
    <h2 id="teamwork-title">Hell Is Not, Surprisingly, Other People</h2>
    
    <p id="teamwork-text">As you could see in the previous image, we were five working on the project and divided the roles among ourselves. <strong>I was mainly in charge of editing and the interview, but I also helped in other areas, although my teammates were much more competent in those aspects!</strong> In the end, we all enjoyed collaborating and were able to work efficiently together. It was a refreshing and enriching experience!</p>
    
    <h2 id="conclusion-title">Conclusion</h2>
    
    <p id="conclusion-text">Despite technical constraints and tight timing, we managed to produce a three-minute video effectively summarizing our work. This experience allowed us to explore all stages of video production, from preparation to distribution, while providing us with valuable multimedia project management skills.</p>
