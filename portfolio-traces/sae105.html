    <h2 id="presentation-title">Presentation</h2>

    <p id="presentation-text">During <strong>SAE 105</strong>, we were asked to design and create a website on a free topic, which had to use <strong><code>JSON</code> files to store values</strong> and <strong><code>PHP</code> files to retrieve them</strong>. Everything was organized on 6 pages that we'll look at, as they all have something special. Especially the "secret page"...</p>
    
    <h2 id="index-title">The index page</h2>

    <p id="index-text-1">The <strong>index</strong> page has nothing special: it's a page that <strong>serves as a hub</strong> and redirects to all other pages. The only interesting thing we can notice on this one is a <strong>3D plastic duck that can be rotated</strong>. But how did I do that? Well, with the <code>Three.js</code> module! Once imported into the site files, it's just a matter of modifying the code a bit so that the part that displays the image takes the shape we want. Once that's done, everything is good and ready to use!</p>
    <p id="index-text-2">However, something important is missing... The 3D model of the duck. Yes! I downloaded a model from <em>Sketchfab</em>, then converted it to the <code>.gltf</code> format, which is the type of model supported by <em>Three.js</em>.</p>
    <p id="index-text-3">Once my duck was imported, I just had to code 2 or 3 additional lines to prevent the duck from moving, and that was it! <strong>I had a super cool 3D duck! ☺️</strong></p>

    <h2 id="data-title">The data page</h2>

    <p id="data-text">The <strong>data</strong> page had to contain a table of values to be retrieved from a <code>JSON</code> file using the <em>dataTables</em> module. Since I had already used <code>JSON</code> in my games and on my personal website to manage translations, this was child's play here. It was just a matter of reading a bit of the <em>dataTables</em> documentation and the table was ready to use. I don't have much more to say about this, as it was, in reality, quite simple.</p>

    <h2 id="gallery-title">The gallery page</h2>

    <p id="gallery-text-1">In the <strong>gallery</strong> page, we were asked to design a system that would take images and then integrate them into the site. Only conditions: <strong>they had to be in <code>.jpeg</code> format and not exceed 200 ko</strong>.</p>
    <p id="gallery-text-2">Many people simply modified the image size via <em>Gimp</em> or <em>Photoshop</em>, or even using a website. But I find this approach long and boring, especially when we have the possibility to code a solution!</p>
    <p id="gallery-text-3">That's exactly what I did. First, we had to <strong>take the image and convert it to <code>JPEG</code> format</strong>, which is easily done with the line of code:</p>
    <p id="gallery-code"><code>imagecreatefromjpeg($img);</code></p>
    <p id="gallery-text-4">Once the image was converted, it was just a matter of <strong>putting it in a loop to reduce its size until it weighed less than 200 ko</strong>!</p>
    <p id="gallery-text-5">For uploading the image, we just had to follow the course instructions, which was done without any problems! (It was just a matter of saving it in the site files.)</p>

    <h2 id="contact-title">The contact page</h2>

    <p id="contact-text-1">The <strong>contact</strong> page honestly has nothing special. Again, it was just a matter of following the course and <strong>using the <code>mail()</code> function to send an email by retrieving form data</strong>. I'll go over it quickly, as I didn't do anything particularly original, just following what was asked of me.</p>
    
    <img src="images/portfolio/sae105-4.webp" alt="Contact page" id="contact-page">
    
    <p id="contact-text-2">I also take this opportunity to mention that I created a <code>JavaScript</code> file that makes small plastic ducks fall in the background, which <strong>makes the background a bit less empty</strong>!</p>
    
    <img src="images/portfolio/sae105-5.webp" alt="Falling ducks background" id="falling-ducks">
    
    <h2 id="partners-title">The partners page</h2>
    
    <p id="partners-text-1">This page was also meant to be used to <strong>display the partners of our fictional company created in another SAE</strong>. It's therefore simply a page with our first and last names, and not much more, apart from a few texts.</p>
    
    <img src="images/portfolio/sae105-6.webp" alt="Partners page" id="partners-page">
    
    <p id="partners-text-2">However, I still took the liberty of adding a fun feature: when you hover over one of our heads, the image flips to display a "funny" photo of us. I don't know why, but I always love making improbable faces in my photos... It's probably going to cost me my future job one of these days.</p>

    <h2 id="credits-title">The credits page</h2>
    
    <p id="credits-text">The <strong>credits</strong> page, which was requested, groups all the links to the resources I used, such as fonts, images, and 3D models. It remains very simple.</p>
    
    <img src="images/portfolio/sae105-8.webp" alt="Credits page" id="credits-page">
    
    <h2 id="secret-title">"The other page"</h2>
    
    <p><sub>...</sub></p>
    <p id="secret-text-2"><sub>Should I talk about it?</sub></p>
    <p><sub>...</sub></p>
    <p id="secret-text-4"><sub>That would be quite bold, especially on a portfolio...</sub></p>
    <p id="secret-text-5"><sub>But on the other hand, there's a sector analysis effort...</sub></p>
    <p id="secret-text-6"><sub>But, on this kind of site...</sub></p>
    <p><sub>...</sub></p>
    
    <p id="secret-text-8"><strong>Alright!</strong> Well, let's talk about the other page!</p>
    <p id="secret-text-9">One of our professors told us that "<em>it was okay to put a fun little easter egg.</em>" So, being the smart guy I am, I decided to really take this suggestion at face value and add "<em>a fun little easter egg</em>" to my website.</p>
    <p id="secret-text-10">Here's how it works: when you reload or change pages three times, a popup appears with the following message:<br><strong>"Hot ducks in your area"</strong>, accompanied by a <strong>"sign up"</strong> button.</p>
    
    <img src="images/portfolio/sae105-9.webp" alt="Easter egg popup" id="easter-popup">
    
    <p id="secret-text-11">You're probably starting to guess where this joke is going to take us...</p>
    <p id="secret-text-12">By clicking the button, you're redirected to another page. And there, I hope for you that it's not familiar. No need to draw a picture: it's a parody of <em>"that famous website"</em>.</p>
    
    <img src="images/portfolio/sae105-10.webp" alt="Parody website" id="parody-site">
    
    <p id="secret-text-13">By clicking the "I am a duck - Enter" button, you'll have access to a whole bunch of duck videos! And I even took the time to make all the thumbnails, it was quite fun to do!</p>
    
    <img src="images/portfolio/sae105-11.webp" alt="Duck video thumbnails" id="duck-thumbnails">
    
    <p id="secret-text-14">To go even further in my silliness, I created a fake advertisement for a pill "<em>that could make your duck grow about 20 times bigger.</em>" I even used <em>Photoshop</em> <strong>to remove the original duck from a photo and paste another one on top</strong>. Well, I must admit that it's a bit noticeable, especially because of the grass in the background that moves.</p>
    
    <img src="images/portfolio/sae105-12.gif" alt="Fake duck pill advertisement" id="duck-pill">
    
    <p id="secret-text-15">This fake advertisement was so well done that it was being blocked by my own ad blocker! I had to be clever and change its name in the HTML file so it would display correctly (yes, we're at that point).</p>
    <p id="secret-text-16">You're probably wondering: "But how did he manage to have a website that looks so much like the original?" Well, believe it or not, I managed to find an image where all the explicit content of the site had been replaced by cute ones... Yes, the little "<em>yellow TicTacs</em>" from <em>Despicable Me</em>. Even the texts had been adapted, which was perfect for me. I just had to copy everything.</p>
    <p id="secret-text-17">Finally, to top it all off, when you click on a video, the user is <strong>redirected to a video I had made myself</strong>. In this video, I directly address our professor telling him that <em>"it's not good to go on sites like that while grading papers"</em>.</p>
    
    <img src="images/portfolio/sae105-13.webp" alt="Professor message video" id="professor-message">
    
    <p id="secret-text-18">It could have stopped there... But no! This joke went in front of the entire amphitheater, with its <span style="font-size: 36pt;"><strong>150</strong></span> students!</p>
    
    <img src="images/portfolio/sae105-14.webp" alt="Amphitheater presentation" id="amphitheater">
    
    <p id="secret-text-19">I've never been so scared in my life, but everyone burst out laughing. It's a golden memory that I'll keep precious until my grave!</p>
    <p id="secret-text-20">...</p>
    <p id="conclusion">Sorry, and thanks for reading! 😭</p>
