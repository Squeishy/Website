    <p id="presentation-text-1">The second game I created for the arcade machine, <em>Tankerz</em> is a game playable by 1 to 2 players locally. <strong>Players each control a tank that must shoot all enemies and score as many points as possible before dying</strong>. They can raise and lower their cannon and move with their joystick. The B1 button allows them to shoot.</p>
    
    <p id="presentation-text-2">The enemies are quite varied: <strong>drones, helicopters, soldiers (two types) and explosive barrels</strong>.</p>
    
    <h3 id="learning-title">What This Game Taught Me</h3>
    
    <p id="learning-text-1">Each level is <strong>randomly generated from prefabricated terrain parts</strong>, and the same goes for enemy spawning. Thus, each game is different, and this mechanic taught me how to implement this type of <strong>procedural generation</strong>, a simple but essential skill in game dev!</p>
    
    <img src="images/portfolio/tankerz-1.webp" alt="Tankerz gameplay screenshot 1" id="gameplay-1">
    
    <p id="learning-text-2">But THE main skill this game taught me was <strong>inheritance in programming</strong>. In other words, <strong>we can create a base script that shares its code with child scripts</strong>. This not only <strong>optimizes code lines by avoiding redundancies, but also allows us to manipulate different types of objects generically.</strong></p>
    <p id="learning-text-3">For example, all <code>destructible</code> elements in the game have their own script (like <code>Helicopter.cs</code> or <code>Soldier.cs</code>), but these scripts derive from a parent script named <code>Destructible.cs</code>. <strong>This script contains common properties like health points, explosion prefabs,</strong> etc. Thus, <strong>each game element can have a health bar and a specific type of destruction while maintaining its unique characteristics</strong> (for example, the helicopter flies and the soldier shoots).</p>
    
    <img src="images/portfolio/tankerz-2.webp" alt="Tankerz code example" id="code-example">
    
    <p id="learning-text-4">This inheritance principle will be heavily reused in my game <em>Dashing Krew</em>, which I'll present in another post!</p>
    
    <h2 id="fun-stuff-title">The Fun Stuff</h2>
    
    <p id="fun-stuff-text-1">I love adding easter eggs (hidden or secret elements) to my games. Here are two examples:</p>
    <p id="fun-stuff-text-2"><strong>The soldiers</strong>: Their heads have a... particular design. That's normal, because their face texture is me! I also asked a friend if they wanted to participate, and they accepted. The result is just too good!</p>

    <img src="images/portfolio/tankerz-4.webp" alt="Tankerz soldier faces 2" id="soldier-faces-2">
    
    <p id="fun-stuff-text-3">The main menu music: If you listen carefully, you'll hear music coming from a radio. If it sounds familiar, it's a melody that the internet took years to find... but I won't say more. Those who know, know.</p>
    
    <h2 id="collaboration-title">Working with Others</h2>
    
    <p id="collaboration-text-1">Since <em>Tankerz</em> is designed for an arcade machine, <strong>we had to implement a highscore system and specific inputs for the machine's buttons</strong>. Unlike classic controls (keyboard or analog joystick), arcade machines use special buttons. For this, our teacher, Jules, created a package called <em>Anatidae</em>, <strong>which handles these inputs and the highscore system</strong>. This package, available on <em>GitHub</em>, had to be read, understood, and integrated into my project to get the final game.</p>
    <p id="collaboration-text-2">The biggest difficulty was related to the highscore system: on the arcade machine, scores are stored on the school's internet network. However, during development, <strong>I had to configure a mini-local server on my computer</strong>, a task that Jordan Septier from 8 months ago had no idea how to do. But in the end, I managed!</p>
    
    <h2 id="tools-3d-title">Blender & Mixamo</h2>
    
    <p id="tools-3d-text-1">3D game means 3D models, and 3D models means <em>Blender</em> (or <em>Maya</em>, if you have 2000â‚¬ to waste). <strong>All 3D models in the game were created by me</strong> in <em>Blender</em>. I won't hide that I'm terrible at art: I master <em>Blender</em> very well, but as soon as we talk about artistic aspects, I'm lost.</p>
    <p id="tools-3d-text-2">From images found online, <strong>I designed the tank, helicopters, drones</strong> (from my game <em>Home Appliance War</em>), etc. Everything was made in a low poly style (with few polygons), to keep it simple and efficient.</p>
    
    <img src="images/portfolio/tankerz-5.webp" alt="Tankerz 3D models" id="models">
    
    <p id="tools-3d-text-3"><strong>The tank and helicopter animations were made by me,</strong> but for the soldiers, I used <em>Mixamo</em>, an online tool from <em>Adobe</em>. <em>Mixamo</em> <strong>offers a large library of ready-to-use animations</strong> that can be imported directly onto our models. We can also upload custom models for amazing results, even for beginners!</p>
