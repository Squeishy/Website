    <h3><strong id="main-title">What would launch me into the most beautiful years of my life...</strong></h3>

    <p id="first-paragraph">
        When I was in tenth grade, I was already interested in digital creation and wanted to learn to code. <em>Spiral Maker</em> was one of my first programming adventures that I completed, and it taught me several basics. Of course, the site's code itself is horrible, since it was my first website, but it was interesting to create.
    </p>
    <p id="second-paragraph">
        Coded in two days, <em>Spiral Maker</em> serves to create spirals (if you're bilingual, this shouldn't surprise you) by modifying and playing with parameters to generate all kinds of spirals: round ones, big ones, spiky ones, beautiful ones... Whatever! Once your work is finished, you can save the image and use it as an illustration, but you could also go <strong>back</strong> and <strong>forward</strong> (undo redo), <strong>clear the canvas</strong>, etc...
    </p>
    <p id="third-paragraph">
        This experience also taught me to use <strong>GitHub</strong> for the first time, a tool that would save my life in the years to come. I also started to understand <strong>CSS</strong> and <strong>HTML</strong>, but especially <strong>JavaScript</strong>, which dynamically generates spirals based on user choices.
