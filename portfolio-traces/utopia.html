    <h2 id="presentation-title">Presentation</h2>

    <p id="presentation-text-1">In SAE 103, we were asked to <strong>design and create a new logo and a new graphic charter for the Utopia cinema</strong> in Troyes. The objective was to <strong>propose a visual identity that aligns with their history, clientele, and the services they offer.</strong></p>
    <p id="presentation-text-2">To achieve this, <strong>we had to develop a graphic charter and create numerous sketches as well as a moodboard to design a logo</strong> that was relevant and appropriate, but more modern and better anchored in our time.</p>
    
    <h2 id="observations-title">Basic Observations</h2>
    
    <p id="observations-intro">Let's start by understanding our subject by visiting the cinema's website.</p>
    
    <img src="images/portfolio/utopia-1.webp" alt="Utopia website screenshot 1" id="website-screenshot-1">
    <img src="images/portfolio/utopia-2.webp" alt="Utopia website screenshot 2" id="website-screenshot-2">
    
    <p id="website-analysis-1">Needless to say that <strong>the website and logo have a somewhat dated look, but nevertheless maintain all the codes of the old era</strong>: the use of a handwritten look on the website, retro colors like red or brown, and especially a completely non-responsive website.</p>
    <p id="website-analysis-2">Thus, in my logo, I will <strong>want to keep this somewhat retro aspect while keeping in mind that we need a more modern logo!</strong></p>
    
    <h2 id="moodboard-title">Creating the Moodboard</h2>
    
    <img src="images/portfolio/utopia-3.webp" alt="Utopia moodboard" id="moodboard">
    
    <p id="moodboard-analysis">My moodboard, although imperfect, <strong>helped me find my colors, ideas, and graphic style</strong>. I wanted something related to space, a recurring theme in old movies.</p>
    
    <h2 id="sketches-title">Creating Sketches</h2>
    
    <p id="sketches-intro">To begin, I <strong>took the time to analyze several logos of independent cinemas to identify current graphic trends</strong>. I then embarked on a series of sketches, seeking to find a balance between the retro side of the Utopia cinema and a more contemporary touch. My first ideas were a film reel... and a lemon?</p>
    
    <img src="images/portfolio/utopia-4.webp" alt="Utopia initial sketches" id="initial-sketches">
    
    <p id="sketches-analysis">I really liked the logo in the top right and decided to continue in this direction, avoiding "<em>the lemon that had no business being there</em>", according to my professor. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">(In hindsight, he wasn't wrong.)</span></p>
    
    <img src="images/portfolio/utopia-5.webp" alt="Utopia logo development" id="logo-development">
    
    <p id="logo-description">After creating four other versions of the logo I liked, <strong>I achieved a really convincing result</strong>: the film reel at the top first represents cinema, but also the retro aspect of the place. The banner around the logo is a film reel where the word "Utopia" is inscribed. Finally, the sun below gives a planetary aspect to the cinema and confers a "worldwide" dimension, while also sparking children's curiosity with the space theme!</p>
    
    <h3 id="digital-title">From Paper to Screen</h3>
    
    <p id="digital-process">This transition wasn't complicated, however, <strong>finding the right font proved to be a bit more challenging:</strong> <strong>we wanted a cinema style while incorporating a "newspaper" aspect to the logo</strong>, which I hadn't mentioned earlier to maintain some suspense. Thus, I found two fonts that I decided to keep:</p>
    
    <img src="images/portfolio/utopia-6.webp" alt="Utopia font selection" id="font-selection">
    
    <ul>
        <li id="font-1">
            <strong><em>Playfair Display SC</em></strong> offers an elegant, modern, and sophisticated look.
        </li>
        <li id="font-2">
            <em><strong>MKSansserifLightTallX Regular</strong></em> brings a modern and clean style, perfect for secondary text.
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p id="illustrator-process">Once I found my fonts, <strong>I finalized the logo using <em>Adobe Illustrator</em></strong>, without encountering any difficulties. The most complicated part was <strong>creating the film reel</strong>, which, in reality, only took five minutes. <strong>It was just a matter of creating a special brush and applying it to a line</strong>. The rest of the logo is <strong>composed of simple shapes, assembled using the Shape Builder tool</strong>. And here's the result!</p>
    
    <img src="images/portfolio/utopia-7.webp" alt="Utopia final logo" id="final-logo">
    
    <p id="logo-versions">A light version and a dark version were also created, as requested in the exercise.</p>

    <h3 id="tasks-title">The 12 Tasks of Jordan</h3>
    
    <p id="tasks-intro">In addition to the moodboard and logo, we had to create other works:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li id="task-1">
            <strong>The logo's safety zone</strong>, which corresponds to the size of the white part of the film reel.
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <img src="images/portfolio/utopia-9.webp" alt="Utopia logo safety zone" id="safety-zone">
    
    <ul>
        <li id="task-2"><strong>The favicon</strong>, the small logo that appears in the website tab, featuring a pixelated version of the logo while maintaining its main details.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <img src="images/portfolio/utopia-10.webp" alt="Utopia favicon" id="favicon">
    
    <ul>
        <li id="task-3">
            <strong>Three pictograms on the theme of cinema with a vintage touch</strong>, respecting a design grid.
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <img src="images/portfolio/utopia-11.webp" alt="Utopia pictograms" id="pictograms">
    
    <p id="grid-intro">These had to respect a grid, which you can see here:</p>
    
    <img src="images/portfolio/utopia-12.webp" alt="Utopia design grid" id="design-grid">
    
    <ul>
        <li id="task-4">
            <strong>Several mockups including the logo in different contexts and products</strong>, created in <em>Photoshop</em>. They allow visualizing the integration of the logo in various media (special mention to the cap, which I really like!)
        </li>
    </ul>

    <img src="images/portfolio/utopia-13.webp" alt="Utopia mockups" id="mockups">
    
    <p id="mocups-joke">The "mo-<em>cups</em>": cups featuring the cinema, but also because they're mockups, "mo-<em>cups</em>", cups, in English...</p>
    
    <img src="images/portfolio/utopia-14.webp" alt="Utopia mocups" id="mocups">
    
    <ul>
        <li id="task-5">
            <strong>The photographic direction</strong>, which I kept very simple: a <strong>desaturated sepia</strong>. To achieve this effect, we apply a black and white filter to the image, then add a yellow tint. <strong>This brings a warmer and more welcoming atmosphere</strong>, while recalling old newspapers printed in black and white, which corresponds to the vintage and welcoming aspect we were looking for.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="details-title">The Little Details</h3>
    
    <p id="details-intro">One thing that sometimes disappoints me in people's work <strong>is the lack of fun or personal little details.</strong> I like my work to be <strong>instantly recognizable</strong>, rather than resembling everything that's already been seen. That's why I always integrate little secrets in my projects to make them unique!</p>
    
    <img src="images/portfolio/utopia-16.webp" alt="Utopia details" id="details">
    
    <p id="font-example">For example, the example text for the fonts isn't the traditional "<em>Lorem Ipsum</em>", but rather "<em>Chatus Gepetus</em>", a reference to <em>ChatGPT</em>!</p>
    
    <img src="images/portfolio/utopia-17.webp" alt="Utopia font examples" id="font-examples">
    
    <p id="easter-eggs">In addition to the "<em>hilarious mo-cups</em>", I modified the logo on the last page to add a final fun touch: the Futurama characters have repainted the logo. Also, Fry and Bender (the red-haired man and the robot, to the right of the logo) are holding paint bombs in their hands.</p>
    <p id="easter-eggs-purpose">The purpose of these little secrets isn't to be mocking, <strong>but rather to bring a touch of fun to my work, making the exam more enjoyable for the professor.</strong> It transforms the correction into a kind of Easter egg hunt!</p>
    <p id="conclusion">Thanks for reading !</p>
