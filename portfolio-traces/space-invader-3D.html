    <h3 id="presentation-title">Presentation</h3>
    
    <p id="presentation-intro">At the end of my senior year at Les Lombards, we were asked to <strong>code a Space Invaders as a final project</strong>, a simple 2D game using <em>Tkinter</em> (a <em>Python</em> module for creating graphical interfaces).</p>
    <p id="presentation-3d-choice">Except that I didn't want to make, yet again, a 2D project that we had already done about twenty times. So I <strong>decided to make it in 3D</strong>.</p>
    <p id="presentation-engine">And here, you might be thinking: "With today's tools, that's simple! There's <em>Blender</em> and surely many <em>Python</em> modules that allow for 3D." Except no. <strong>I completely coded my own 3D engine</strong>, using <em>Tkinter</em>, which is <strong>absolutely not designed for this</strong>.</p>
    <p id="presentation-transition">Let's see how I made this project!</p>
    
    <h3 id="understanding-3d-title">Understanding 3D Space</h3>
    
    <p id="understanding-2d">Before explaining how my engine works, we need to <strong>first understand how 3D space works</strong>. Let's start with 2D space: <strong>it is defined by two dimensions, the abscissa (x) and the ordinate (y).</strong> For example, a square has four points.</p>
    <p id="understanding-3d">In 3D, <strong>we add a third dimension</strong>, called the height or depth (z-axis). Our square becomes a cube and gains four additional vertices, for a total of eight.</p>
    <p id="understanding-vertices">Thus, to represent a cube in 3D, <strong>we must first define its skeleton</strong>, meaning its vertices (called "vertices"), which I coded by creating a <em>Vertex</em> class that contains <strong>coordinates and a function to move</strong>!</p>
    
    <img src="images/portfolio/space-invader-1.webp" alt="Diagram showing 2D and 3D coordinate systems" id="space-invader-1">
    
    <h3 id="vertices-cube-title">Creating Vertices and the Cube</h3>
    
    <p id="vertex-class">When creating a vertex, we pass its coordinates (x, y, z) as parameters and assign them to it. The <code>changePosition(self, valx, valy, valz)</code> method allows modifying its position, while <code>__str__(self)</code> facilitates debugging by displaying the point's coordinates.</p>
    <p id="cube-class">With this vertex class in place, we can create our cube. <strong>It has a vertex to designate the center, a side attribute that represents its size, a color, and a name.</strong></p>
    <p id="cube-vertices">From the center, we generate eight other vertices in each direction (see <code>self.vertices</code>). <strong>These vertices then allow us to create the cube's faces.</strong></p>
    
    <img src="images/portfolio/space-invader-2.webp" alt="Code showing cube vertex generation" id="space-invader-2">
    
    <p id="other-shapes">I used the cube as an example because it's the simplest to model, but it's <strong>certainly possible to design other shapes, like an octahedron</strong>.</p>
    
    <img src="images/portfolio/space-invader-3.webp" alt="Example of an octahedron shape" id="space-invader-3">
    
    <h3 id="display-title">Displaying Shapes on Screen</h3>
    
    <p id="display-intro">For now, we just have a series of numerical values, <strong>but nothing displayed on screen</strong>. Don't worry, this is where we'll work on rendering.</p>
    <p id="objects-list">An <code>objects</code> list contains all the game's shapes (cubes, octahedrons, pyramids...).</p>
    <p id="render-process">The rendering process goes like this:</p>
    
    <img src="images/portfolio/space-invader-4.webp" alt="Code showing the rendering process" id="space-invader-4">
    
    <p id="render-steps">We <strong>clear the canvas before redrawing to avoid overlapping old images</strong>. Then we <strong>determine the center of the screen, essential for creating the perspective effect</strong>. Although my game is in 3D, the screen remains 2D! So we need to <strong>simulate depth by adjusting x and y based on z</strong>. The further an object is (higher z), <strong>the closer it gets to the center</strong> (vanishing point). Then, we need to sort the objects (<code>sorted_objects</code>) to ensure those further back appear behind others (this never worked, whatever I did). Finally, for each face of an object, <strong>we connect the vertices to draw the shapes.</strong></p>
    
    <h3 id="animation-title">Animation and Object Rotation</h3>
    
    <p id="animation-intro">To make the game a bit more lively, <strong>it would be nice to rotate the objects</strong>, to animate everything. To do this, rotation relies on applying transformation matrices.</p>
    <p id="rotation-process">What we do is, <strong>for each vertex, we create a temporary vertex, then apply a rotation matrix on the x-axis</strong>, finally, <strong>we update the original vertex's coordinates</strong>. Once this is done, <strong>we repeat with y and z</strong>. Note that this code could be largely optimized, but I didn't have those kinds of skills at the time!</p>
    
    <img src="images/portfolio/space-invader-5.webp" alt="Code showing rotation matrix application" id="space-invader-5">
    
    <p id="game-result">With a few additional objects and some code, here's the result in-game:</p>
    
    <img src="images/portfolio/space-invader-6.webp" alt="Screenshot of the game in action" id="space-invader-6">
    
    <p id="gameplay-explanation">The pink cube represents the player with a shield. Without a shield, it's white. <strong>The goal is to shoot the aliens</strong> (the colored shapes at the top of the screen) by moving through space and eliminating them!</p>
    
    <h3 id="effects-title">Visual Effects and Gameplay</h3>
    
    <p id="visual-effects">In the <code>render</code> function, you'll notice the <code>x_noise</code> and <code>y_noise</code> variables. They serve <strong>to make the objects' faces shake</strong>, simulating for example an explosion when an alien is destroyed. By combining this effect with a color inversion, the visual impact is perfect!</p>
    
    <img src="images/portfolio/space-invader-7.webp" alt="Example of visual effects in the game" id="space-invader-7">
    
    <p id="alien-movement">The aliens move from front to back while gradually descending. <strong>To vary the gameplay, I added bosses.</strong></p>
    
    <img src="images/portfolio/space-invader-8.webp" alt="Screenshot of a boss battle" id="space-invader-8">
    
    <p id="boss-mechanics"><strong>The boss moves randomly in the combat zone. The more damage you inflict, the smaller and faster it becomes, making the fight more difficult</strong>. If it touches the player, it's game over. (The cyan square above the player indicates a double-shot bonus.)</p>
    <p id="debug-mode">After completing the 26 levels and defeating the 3 bosses, <strong>a message informs the player that they've unlocked Debug Mode</strong>.</p>
    
    <img src="images/portfolio/space-invader-9.webp" alt="Screenshot showing debug mode unlock" id="space-invader-9">
    
    <h3 id="debug-title">Debug Mode and 3D Collision</h3>
    
    <p id="debug-features">Once Debug Mode is activated, you <strong>can move your camera, kill all enemies with one shot, and change the FOV</strong> (field of view, the camera's field) <strong>of the camera</strong>.</p>
    
    <img src="images/portfolio/space-invader-10.webp" alt="Screenshot of debug mode features" id="space-invader-10">
    
    <p id="collision-intro">Detecting <strong>collisions in 3D is an interesting challenge.</strong> Due to perspective, here's the method I used:</p>
    
    <img src="images/portfolio/space-invader-11.webp" alt="Code showing collision detection" id="space-invader-11">
    
    <p id="collision-method">We simply check if an object's coordinates (pos) are inside shape1, hitbox (which should be called offset rather than hitbox) allows reducing or increasing the collision box size.</p>
    
    <h3 id="depth-perception-title">Perceiving Depth in 3D</h3>
    
    <p id="depth-problem">A problem in 3D is the difficulty of evaluating depth. Look at this image:</p>
    
    <img src="images/portfolio/space-invader-12.webp" alt="Screenshot showing depth perception challenge" id="space-invader-12">
    
    <p id="depth-solution">Could you tell me exactly where the aliens are on the Z-axis? Are they close or far? Take the blue cube, the orange pyramid, and the yellow pyramid above the player, they seem to be at the same level. Well no! They are completely far apart, and it's impossible to see! So I added an indicator that helps the player better orient themselves in space, go take a look at the screenshots at the top of this post when we're in-game and tell me what indicators were used to improve the sense of perspective!</p>
    <p id="shadow-system">If you say the "shadows" of each alien, you're right! <strong>I added a kind of ground marking for each alien to be able to see where the alien is in relation to the z-axis</strong>, and it greatly improves the gameplay! Also, if you look carefully, <strong>the closer the alien is to the ground, the bigger its shadow will be</strong>, to indicate that it's more important to kill it first, as it represents a bigger danger than the others!</p>
    
    <h3 id="audio-title">Sounds, Music, and Save System</h3>
    
    <p id="audio-implementation">Everything was done without using <em>Pygame</em> (except for music) or any module for 3D. <strong>I added sound effects and an original soundtrack designed for the game</strong>. Finally, a <code>JSON</code> format save system allows preserving progress!</p>
