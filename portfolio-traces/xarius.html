    <p id="presentation-text">The third game I created for the arcade machine, <em>Xarius</em> is a game playable by <strong>1 to 4 players locally.</strong> Players participate in a space race in ships and must reach the finish line first. I'm particularly proud of this project because of the time it took me to create it: only <strong>5 days</strong> to create all the models, music, sounds, code, the two levels and additional content (miniatures, etc.).</p>
    
    <h2 id="problem-title">Problem</h2>
    
    <p id="problem-text-1">If you've seen the arcade machine at school, you've probably noticed that it only has two joysticks and buttons. So, how did I manage to make a game playable by four players locally on this machine that seems limited to two simultaneous players?</p>
    <p id="problem-text-2">I significantly reduced the controls of each ship by only allowing them to move up and down and left and right. With so few controls, it's possible to assign <strong>joysticks to players 1 and 3</strong> and <strong>buttons to players 2 and 4</strong>. Thus, <em>Xarius</em> became <strong>the first game to offer a 4-player mode on this machine!</strong></p>

    <h2 id="how-it-works-title">How does it work?</h2>
    
    <p id="how-it-works-text-1">In the game, each player follows a line that traces the level. They can't move away from it, but can <strong>move up and down and left and right along it.</strong> The game automatically advances players along this line.</p>
    <p id="how-it-works-text-2">Thanks to these super simple controls, I was able to make a 4-player local experience possible. In-game, players can <strong>use speed tunnels to accelerate</strong>, but they must also <strong>avoid obstacles in their path.</strong> At the risk of losing all their speed and having to regain it gradually.</p>

    <p id="technical-text-1">Honestly, there isn't much complexity in this game in terms of code. However, the most technical part remains the level editor.</p>
    <p id="technical-text-2">I developed a script that <strong>takes a series of points and traces a level by connecting them</strong>. It's possible to add or remove these points, and players automatically follow this path. This allows for <strong>quick and efficient level creation</strong>. Here are the two levels I created: Earth and <em>Tankerz</em> (a reference to my other game of the same name).</p>

    <p id="level-choice-text">I chose to integrate a map inspired by <em>Tankerz</em> to save time: I already had most of the assets and a musical base. I just had to make some modifications.</p>

    <h2 id="biggest-challenge-title">The Biggest Challenge</h2>
    
    <p id="challenge-text-1"><em>Xarius</em>, 4 players, in space... it's super cool, but try running that on the arcade machine's (desktop) computer! It had to handle 4 cameras and perform separate calculations for each player simultaneously. Result? The poor thing was crying, barely displaying 20 FPS.</p>
    <p id="challenge-text-2">What to do? My game was finished, but unplayable due to lack of optimization. So I completely rethought it!</p>
    <p id="challenge-text-3">For example, the 3D model of the asteroids contained a huge number of polygons, which was too resource-intensive. I simplified their geometry as well as that of the ships and other game objects. <strong>Going from 7,500,000 to 250,000 polygons for 4 players.</strong></p>
    
    <img src="images/portfolio/xarius-7.webp" alt="Xarius optimization comparison" id="optimization">
    
    <p id="optimization-text-1">But that wasn't enough. I also <strong>optimized the materials</strong>: removed reflections, metallic effects and shadows, and enabled "GPU Instancing" so all objects share the same material rather than having individual ones.</p>
    <p id="optimization-text-2">The result? We go from 20 FPS to a comfortable 60 FPS!</p>
    
    <h2 id="music-title">The Music (The Best Part)</h2>
    
    <p id="music-text-1">Space means grand music. But Jordan Septier means budding composer... or torture for the ears! I had some music skills, but not enough to compose a good soundtrack.</p>
    <p id="music-text-2">While trying to create the music for Earth, I found a superb bass line and a space piano, but I was stuck. How to continue? I called on a friend, <strong>Lauren Lamoureux</strong> (thank you a thousand times again!). After four hours on Discord voice chat composing together, I had my best music to date!</p>
    <p id="music-text-3">For <em>Tankerz</em>, I took the original game's music and remixed it by adapting the instruments. The result made me very proud, especially after applying all of Lauren's advice.</p>
    <p id="music-text-4">She taught me to create smooth transitions, use an appropriate musical style and choose my instruments well. A huge thank you to her!</p>
    <p id="music-link">(You can find the music here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1EOx_vFhWaLanuS5AQbU-sd5QzjCVJNBs)</p>
    
    <h2 id="anecdotes-title">Anecdotes</h2>
    <p id="anecdote-1">If you're wondering why I named my game <em>Xarius</em>, it's in homage to one of my teachers, who uses this nickname on Discord. He's the one who coded the game upload system for the arcade machine!</p>
    <p id="anecdote-2">The game is also very inspired by <strong>StarFox</strong>, I probably listened to the SNES version of Corneria on loop during the entire game creation!</p>
