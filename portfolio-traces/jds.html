    <h4 id="presentation-title">Presentation</h4>
    <p id="presentation-text">Well, good evening and welcome to this new trace where we'll discover my YouTube channel, Joueur du Soir, which talks <strong>about video games of all kinds</strong>!</p>
    <h4 id="videos-title">Videos for all tastes!</h4>
    <p id="videos-intro">On my YouTube channel, I have <strong>three main types of videos</strong>, which are:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p id="corruption-videos">Corruption videos<br>This is, I would say, <strong>75% of my channel</strong>. The goal of corruption is to modify a game's values to make it have a kind of heart attack. This creates completely random and crazy effects that I enjoy presenting to the world! I corrupt all types of games: 3DS, Wii, PS1, but also GameCube games!</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p id="presentation-videos">Presentation videos<br>These are videos where I present <strong>either game secrets or the game itself</strong>. It's super fun to make and much easier to produce than corruption videos.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p id="original-concepts">Original concepts<br>For example, in my latest video, <strong>I talked about how video games are represented in TV media</strong>. They often get it completely wrong when trying to create fake video games. It's my favorite one so far!</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h4 id="behind-scenes-title">Come discover behind the scenes!</h4>
    <p id="behind-scenes-intro">Creating videos is far from simple. Here's how it works for me when I make videos!</p>
    <p id="corruption-process-title"><strong>For corruption videos:</strong></p>
    <p id="corruption-step-1">1. The corruption<br>I start by downloading the game I want to corrupt. Then, <strong>I record the corruption effects on video</strong>.</p>
    <img src="images/portfolio/jds-1.webp" alt="Corruption recording setup" id="corruption-setup">
    <p id="corruption-step-2">2. Writing<br>I <strong>write a script based on the effects obtained</strong>. This is also the stage where I decide what stays and what isn't interesting.</p>
    <p id="corruption-step-3">3. Recording</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p id="recording-setup">At the beginning of each video, I speak in front of the camera in a set that needs to be prepared. This includes setting up my camera, lights and rendering, but also putting sheets everywhere in my room to avoid sound reverberation.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <img src="images/portfolio/jds-2.webp" alt="Recording setup" id="recording-setup-image">
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p id="recording-process">Then, I do takes for an hour or two, which I'll later integrate into the video.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p id="script-recording">After that, I record my entire script orally. It's simpler, but it takes more time. On one hand, I can read my notes (unlike when I speak to camera), but I also have more things to read and say!</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p id="corruption-step-4">4. Editing<br>Once all that is done, I move on to editing. This takes me between two and three days.</p>

    <img src="images/portfolio/jds-3.webp" alt="Editing process" id="editing-process">

    <p id="corruption-step-5">5. The thumbnail<br>Finally, all that's left is to create the thumbnail, my favorite moment!</p>

    <img src="images/portfolio/jds-4.webp" alt="Thumbnail creation 1" id="thumbnail-1">
    <img src="images/portfolio/jds-5.webp" alt="Thumbnail creation 2" id="thumbnail-2">
    <img src="images/portfolio/jds-6.webp" alt="Thumbnail creation 3" id="thumbnail-3">

    <p id="other-videos-process"><strong>For other videos:</strong></p>
    <p id="other-videos-description">The process is similar, except that I write my script before recording what I need in-game.</p>

    <h4 id="channel-memes-title">Channel Memes</h4>

    <p id="memes-intro">A YouTube channel without memes isn't a good YouTube channel! Imagine Squeezie without his "<em>Yo everyone it's Squeezie</em>", Laupok's "<em>and take care</em>", or Leo Tech Maker's "<em>never stop learning</em>"... You see where I'm going!</p>
    <p id="memes-description">On my channel, I have many memes that help me connect with my audience:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <p id="spyro-meme">The <strong>two Spyro plushies</strong> that I own and often make fun of.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p id="tibo-meme">I regularly make fun of <strong>Tibo InShape</strong>, a character I don't particularly like.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="evolution-title">The Evolution</h3>

    <p id="evolution-text">If you watch my latest and first video, you'll see that in just six months, I've improved enormously! The audio is now more consistent, the image is better, and the writing too. In short, I've learned a lot in between, especially the importance of keeping my microphone close to me, which was essential for good sound!</p>
    
    <h3 id="tools-title">My Tools</h3>

    <p id="tools-intro">To carry out my projects, I use different tools depending on my needs:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <p id="tool-obs"><em>OBS Studio</em>: perfect for <strong>recording videos</strong>, whether it's capturing gameplay or the part where I speak to the camera.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p id="tool-audacity"><em>Audacity</em>: which allows me to <strong>record and edit my voice</strong>.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p id="tool-paint"><em>Paint 3D / Figma</em>: perfect for <strong>creating thumbnails</strong>.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p id="tool-olive"><em>Olive</em>: my <strong>video editing</strong> software.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="conclusion-title">Conclusion</h3>

    <p id="conclusion-text">My Joueur du Soir channel is much more than just entertainment for me. It allows me to <strong>share my passion for video games while working on my own video projects</strong>!</p>
