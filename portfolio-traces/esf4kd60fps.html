    <p id="presentation-text">I know this game name might make you smile, and that's the point! "<em>EPIC SNOW FIGHTER 4K DELUXE 60FPS!</em>" is my very first arcade machine game. Before <em>Tankerz</em> and <em>XARIUS</em>, it taught me <strong>the basics of arcade games</strong>!</p>

    <h3 id="frozen-game-title">A Frozen Game!</h3>

    <p id="frozen-game-text">In this game, <strong>2 players must fight each other by throwing snowballs</strong>. They each have 3 lives and can fall into water, which will kill them instantly.</p>

    <p id="maps-text">These players can fight on <strong>4 different maps</strong>: <em>Boxify</em>, <em>ChillMakers</em>, <em>Granity</em> and <em>Shiva</em>.</p>

    <p id="powerups-intro">During the game, <strong>mystery boxes may appear</strong>. By collecting them, players will receive a random power-up, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p role="presentation" id="powerup-gigantism"><strong>Gigantism</strong>, which doubles the player's damage and makes them invincible.</p>

        <li>
            <p role="presentation" id="powerup-shield"><strong>Shield</strong>, which protects the player and hurts the opponent if they get too close.</p>

    <h3 id="illusion-title">An Illusion Before Your Eyes</h3>
    <p id="illusion-text-1">You've probably noticed that as a player, you see your character's hand, while you see the other player's complete body. Well, in reality, it's quite simple (even though I managed to get confused while writing it 😅). Basically, what happens is that the players' cameras can't see the character they control. Instead, they only display the player's arm, as well as the other player's body, but without showing the other arm of the controlled player. And vice versa, of course. Otherwise, it would look like this:</p>

    <img src="images/portfolio/eps4kd60fps-11.webp" alt="ESF4KD60FPS camera comparison" id="camera-comparison">

    <p id="illusion-text-2">Do you understand better now? <strong>For the player's camera, the character is hidden and only their arm is visible. While for the other player's camera, it's the opposite: the arm is hidden, but the character is fully visible!</strong></p>
    <p id="illusion-text-3">Honestly, it might seem complicated to explain, but that's how it works in all multiplayer games. So it's a <strong>great thing to know</strong>!</p>

    <h3 id="adaptive-music-title">Adaptive Music!</h3>
    <p id="adaptive-music-text-1">I thought it would be fun to make music that <strong>adapts to the game</strong>, and that's exactly what I did!</p>
    <p id="adaptive-music-text-2">Each music has 3 "layers":</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p role="presentation" id="music-layer-1"><strong>The base layer</strong>: a melody without anything special.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p role="presentation" id="music-layer-2"><strong>The second layer</strong>: all the "kicks" and "claps" (in short, the percussion).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p role="presentation" id="music-layer-3"><strong>The third layer</strong>: an additional bass line.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <img src="images/portfolio/eps4kd60fps-12.webp" alt="ESF4KD60FPS music layers" id="music-layers">

    <p id="music-explanation-1">By default, <strong>layers 1 and 2 play together</strong>, meaning the melody and percussion. If a player dies, <strong>the percussion stops</strong>, leaving only the base music, then it comes back when they respawn. The third layer, on the other hand, only plays <strong>when one of the players has a power-up</strong>.</p>
    <p id="music-explanation-2">In total, there are <strong>four maps</strong>, so <strong>four different music tracks</strong> (nothing too complicated, it's still made in FL Studio).</p>

    <h3 id="tiny-details-title">The Tiny Details</h3>
    <p id="tiny-details-intro">Something I like to do in my video games (and you already know this with <em>Tankerz</em>) is to <strong>hide small details or Easter Eggs</strong>. Here, there are only details, but they're worth mentioning!</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p role="presentation" id="detail-pupils">First: <strong>The characters' pupils move based on where they're looking</strong>. It's simple, but it uses <strong>blend-keys</strong> in <em>Blender</em>, which allow us to <strong>modify the position of vertices in a 3D model</strong>. The result is super cool!</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <img src="images/portfolio/eps4kd60fps-13.webp" alt="ESF4KD60FPS character pupils" id="character-pupils">

    <ul>
        <li>
            <p role="presentation" id="detail-spectators">Second: You can notice <strong>small characters everywhere on the maps if you pay attention</strong>. And the best part is that they applaud when a player dies!</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <img src="images/portfolio/eps4kd60fps-14.webp" alt="ESF4KD60FPS map spectators" id="map-spectators">

    <ul>
        <li>
            <p role="presentation" id="detail-brands">Finally: In <em>Mario Kart 8</em>, each character has a fake brand or company (for example: "<em>BowserOIL</em>", "<em>MARIO MOTORS</em>", "<em>Lemmy's Tire Service</em>", etc.). Why am I talking about this? I warn you I'm not a "Nintendo fanboy" <span style="font-size: 8pt;">(maybe a little)</span>, but I love these kinds of details that give characters their own life. In the same way, I've integrated <strong>fake brands in this game</strong>, and each <strong>character color in the selection menu has its own personality</strong>.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <img src="images/portfolio/eps4kd60fps-16.webp" alt="ESF4KD60FPS character brands 2" id="character-brands-2">

    <h3 id="recycling-title">Recycle to Win!</h3>
    <p id="recycling-text">Another thing I love to do is <strong>recycle my own creations</strong>. For example, <em>Shiva</em>, one of the game's maps, is entirely copied from <em>HAW (Home Appliance War)</em>. The boats, the logo, the name, even the character in the sweatshirt come from <em>HAW</em>! If only the world could recycle as much as I recycle my games, we'd have reasons to say global warming doesn't exist.</p>

    <img src="images/portfolio/eps4kd60fps-18.webp" alt="ESF4KD60FPS recycling comparison 2" id="recycling-comparison-2">

    <h3 id="problems-title">Nothing But Problems</h3>
    <p id="problems-text-1">Compared to <em>XARIUS</em> and <em>Tankerz</em>, this game was much harder to set up. In fact, it was developed <strong>before the start of the school year</strong>. I was told that my profile interested the university (thanks again for everything, Mr. Meuzeret, that made my vacation), and they wanted me to create a game for an arcade machine.</p>
    <p id="problems-text-2">The issue? I had no idea what the arcade machine looked like. For me, an arcade machine was like the demo screens at Micromania: <strong>a TV and two Xbox or PS4 controllers</strong> (what an idea, where did I get that from 😭). Anyway, I started with <strong>a 3D game with two joysticks per player</strong>.</p>
    <p id="problems-text-3"><strong>What a surprise when I was told there was only one joystick per player!</strong> Not very practical for a 3D environment... But I fought back: I made the <strong>left/right joystick rotate the camera</strong> and the <strong>up/down joystick move the player forward</strong>. It's less maneuverable, but at least it worked!</p>
    <p id="problems-text-4">Another problem: I made the game <strong>TOO FAST</strong>. Development was finished before the arcade machine was configured. Result: at first, everything worked well, but after a machine update, <strong>the inputs completely bugged</strong>. My characters were spinning in place. <em>Tankerz</em> had a similar problem: the cannons pointed upward even when not touching the joysticks.</p>

    <h3 id="conclusion-title">In the End</h3>
    <p id="conclusion-text-1"><em>eps4kd60fps</em> (yes, no courage to rewrite everything 😅) was a great project to cut my teeth on an arcade machine. It allowed me to <strong>understand the basics of what works</strong> (or doesn't). In hindsight, this game isn't really suitable for an arcade machine, too bad!</p>
    <p id="conclusion-text-2">Thanks for reading! 😁</p>
