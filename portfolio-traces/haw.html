    <h2 id="presentation-title">Presentation</h2>

    <p id="presentation-text"><em>HAW</em>, for <em>Home Appliance War</em>, or "The War of Home Appliances", was <strong>my very first real game project that seemed like it could lead to something</strong>. Although it was <strong>never completed</strong>, this game taught me a lot: <strong>3D modeling</strong>, <strong>C#</strong>, <strong>shaders</strong>, <strong>animations</strong>, <strong>online multiplayer</strong>, and even <strong>account management</strong>!</p>

    <h3 id="adventure-start-title">The Beginning of an Adventure</h3>

    <p id="adventure-start-text">To get to the final (unfinished) game, I had to remake the project... <strong>four times</strong>! I was very new to Unity at that time, and even after the fourth attempt, it was far from finished. I ended up abandoning it. Because, let's be honest: creating an online multiplayer game at 15, with no experience or idea of how to do it, is clearly not the key to success...</p>

    <h3 id="multiplayer-title">Let's Talk About Multiplayer</h3>

    <img src="images/portfolio/haw-4.webp" alt="HAW multiplayer screenshot" id="multiplayer-screenshot">

    <p id="multiplayer-intro">For the online gaming system, I used a service called <em>Photon</em> (or <em>Photon.PUN</em> for those in the know), which allowed <strong>hosting and playing on online servers</strong>. Thanks to this, I learned a lot about how networked games work, including:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <p role="presentation" id="owner-client-distinction">The <strong>distinction between owner and client</strong>.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p role="presentation" id="server-sync">The need to <strong>synchronize players through a main server</strong> (and not a client, at the risk of cheating).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p role="presentation" id="online-instances">The <strong>creation of online instances</strong>, like projectiles visible to all players.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p id="multiplayer-conclusion">I discovered the essential basics to avoid cheating issues and ensure a synchronized experience.</p>

    <p id="server-join">You can obviously join online servers and play with people, and change your color too!</p>

    <h3 id="graphics-title">Graphics and 3D Modeling</h3>

    <p id="graphics-intro">This project taught me a lot about <em>Blender</em>, especially regarding <strong>animations</strong>, <strong>textures</strong>, <strong>shaders</strong>, <strong>UVs</strong>, <strong>meshes</strong>, <strong>optimization</strong>, <strong>materials and blend-frames</strong>. Here's the game's main hero:</p>

    <img src="images/portfolio/haw-6.webp" alt="HAW main character current version" id="character-current">

    <p id="character-evolution-1">It's, well, not super super beautiful, but there was worse, its previous version:</p>

    <img src="images/portfolio/haw-7.webp" alt="HAW main character previous version" id="character-previous">

    <p id="character-evolution-2">And before that, there was this horror:</p>

    <img src="images/portfolio/haw-8.webp" alt="HAW main character first version" id="character-first">

    <p id="blender-learning">No need to tell you that this taught me a lot about Blender! By the way, this character's evolution doesn't stop there, it later became like this in another game (which we'll see in another post).</p>

    <img src="images/portfolio/haw-9.webp" alt="HAW character in another game" id="character-other-game">

    <p id="character-evolution-3">Then like this in my most recent game, which we'll also see in another post!</p>

    <h3 id="environment-title">Environment Creation</h3>

    <p id="environment-intro">The entire game was in 3D, including the city, which I remade three times before getting a satisfactory result, always with Blender:</p>

    <img src="images/portfolio/haw-11.webp" alt="HAW city version 1" id="city-version-1">
    <img src="images/portfolio/haw-12.webp" alt="HAW city version 2" id="city-version-2">

    <p id="toon-shader">I also created a "toon" shader to give the game a cartoonish look. This shader slightly saturated the colors and added an outline around objects.</p>

    <h3 id="appliances-title">Finally, the Home Appliances!</h3>

    <img src="images/portfolio/haw-3.webp" alt="HAW home appliances" id="appliances-screenshot">

    <p id="appliances-intro">But now, you're probably saying: "I was told this game is called '<em>The War of Home Appliances</em>', and yet, I don't see any home appliances. I just see a bunch of copies of <em>Kenny McCormick</em> from <em>South Park</em>." Well, that's exactly what we're getting to!</p>
    <p id="appliances-gameplay">The goal of this game was to <strong>push other players into the void with various electrical appliances</strong>, for example <strong>a toaster</strong> or <strong>a fridge</strong> that sent projectiles to push other players away.</p>

    <img src="images/portfolio/haw-13.webp" alt="HAW appliance gameplay" id="appliance-gameplay">
    
    <p id="unity-bug-note"><sub>(The image is way too bright but that's Unity's editor bugging, as usual.)</sub></p>

    <img src="images/portfolio/haw-14.webp" alt="HAW wind-based appliances" id="wind-appliances">

    <p id="wind-appliances-list">Other appliances used wind to push players, like <strong>a vacuum cleaner</strong>, <strong>a leaf blower</strong>, <strong>a fan</strong>, or even <strong>a pressure washer</strong>
    <sub>(now that I think about it, I believe Karcher is a registered trademark, should avoid that in the future.)</sub></p>
    
    <h3 id="gliders-title">Flying with Style</h3>

    <p id="gliders-intro">But that wasn't all! Since the goal of the game was to push each other into the void, there needed to be a way to save yourself. That's how I invented <strong>gliders</strong>, which allowed you to fly in the sky, for example with a Jet Pack:</p>

    <img src="images/portfolio/haw-15.webp" alt="HAW glider gameplay" id="glider-gameplay">

    <p id="glider-joke"><em>(It's true that a glider is a home appliance. I use one every day to do the dishes, it's super practical.)</em></p>

    <h3 id="animations-title">The Animations</h3>

    <p id="animations-intro">When I look at the animators I made back then, I realize how much I've evolved:</p>

    <img src="images/portfolio/haw-16.webp" alt="HAW animation system" id="animation-system">

    <p id="animation-explanation">Transitioning from one animation to another like this was... awful. For those who don't know, the image shows what's called an "Animator" in Unity. This Animator allows you to <strong>transition from one animation to another based on conditions and values</strong>, but here, it was done very poorly and was hardly understandable!</p>

    <h3 id="sound-title">The Sound Design</h3>

    <img src="images/portfolio/haw-17.webp" alt="HAW sound design" id="sound-design">

    <p id="sound-anecdote">A fun anecdote: for the toaster sound that shoots bread, I placed <strong>my toaster and my microphone in a pillowcase to isolate the sound, then recorded while playing with it</strong>.</p>

    <h3 id="conclusion-title">Conclusion</h3>
    
    <p id="conclusion-text-1">The game was far from perfect and remained quite empty, but it took me a lot of time and taught me so much. At the time, I was fighting against Unity to learn literally everything from scratch. Despite that, it was a super fun project to work on!</p>
    <p id="conclusion-text-2">Thanks for reading!</p>
