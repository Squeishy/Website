    <h3 id="presentation-title">Presentation</h3>

    <p id="presentation-game"><strong>Phasmophobia</strong> is a video game where players must identify the type of ghost haunting a location (Poltergeist, Ghost, Demon, etc.). To do this, the player is equipped with various gadgets that help determine the correct entity based on evidence. Each ghost has three specific pieces of evidence that help identify it.</p>
    <p id="presentation-project">During a class project in NSI, we were asked to create a website using SQL databases, which we had to put online and use dynamically via PHP. So I created three tables: one for ghosts, another for objects, and a last one for evidence. This project allowed me to learn the basics of <strong>PHP</strong> and <strong>SQL databases</strong>, as well as the use of <strong><em>AlwaysData</em></strong>, a service for hosting these tables.</p>

    <h3 id="code-title">The Code</h3>

    <p id="code-intro">Here is, for example, a <strong>code excerpt that allows retrieving ghosts associated with certain types of evidence</strong>:</p>
    <p><code>$bdd = new PDO('mysql:host=sql109.infinityfree.com;dbname=if0_36117964_Phasmophobia', 'if0_36117964', '3B5cxq55rcbfYeQ');</code></p>
    <p><code>// Récupérer les preuves</code><br><code>$query = 'SELECT ID AS evidenceID, Name AS evidenceName, Description AS evidenceDescription FROM Evidence';</code><br><code>$response = $bdd->query($query);</code><br><code>$evidenceData = $response->fetchAll(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);</code></p>
    <p><code>// Récupérer les fantômes et leurs preuves</code><br><code>$query = 'SELECT G.ID AS ghostId, G.Name AS ghostName, GROUP_CONCAT(E.ID) AS evidenceIDs</code><br><code>    FROM Ghost AS G</code><br><code>    INNER JOIN Ghost_has_Evidence AS GHE ON GHE.Ghost_ID = G.ID</code><br><code>    INNER JOIN Evidence AS E ON GHE.Evidence_ID = E.ID</code><br><code>    GROUP BY G.ID</code><br><code>    ORDER BY G.ID ASC';</code><br><code>$response = $bdd->query($query);</code><br><code>$ghostData = $response->fetchAll(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);</code></p>

    <h3 id="pages-title">The Pages</h3>

    <p id="pages-intro">The site had several pages:</p>
    <p id="pages-home">The home page (index) allowed navigation throughout the site and access to different tables.</p>

    <p id="pages-entities">The "Entities" page displayed all entities from the database.</p>

    <img src="images/portfolio/phasmophobia-2.webp" alt="Entities Page showing ghost types" id="phasmophobia-2">

    <p id="pages-ghost-details">By clicking a button, you could see the selected ghost with a short description and its evidence. A small image corresponding to the ghost was also displayed.</p>

    <img src="images/portfolio/phasmophobia-3.webp" alt="Detailed ghost information page" id="phasmophobia-3">

    <p id="pages-objects">The "Objects" page listed all objects from the database, showing their price and description. It was possible to modify the tier of objects (three levels: bad, normal, and good) and see the changes in real-time.</p>

    <img src="images/portfolio/phasmophobia-4.webp" alt="Objects page with equipment list" id="phasmophobia-4">

    <p id="pages-evidence">The <strong>"Evidence"</strong> page allowed you to <strong>check/uncheck evidence</strong>, and a JavaScript script would dynamically update the list of corresponding ghosts. Hovering over <strong>evidence would also display an image of it.</strong></p>

    <h3 id="conclusion-title">Conclusion</h3>

    <p id="conclusion-text">In the end, this project allowed me to <strong>deepen my skills in HTML and CSS</strong>, learn <strong>JavaScript</strong>, but most importantly to <strong>manipulate databases in PHP</strong>, all while working on a game I love. The website is unfortunately no longer online, but you can see it by clicking on this link:</p>
